            <h3><a href="https://thebiguglywebsite.com/" class="dark-link">The Big Ugly Website</a></h3>
            <p>The Big Ugly Website is a satirical collection showcasing some of the most poorly designed and aesthetically unpleasing websites on the internet. It serves as a humorous archive, highlighting examples of bad web design for educational and entertainment purposes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast:</b> The site intentionally lacks visual contrast, with clashing colors and unreadable text, exemplifying poor design choices.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition:</b> There is a deliberate absence of cohesive repetition; inconsistent fonts, colors, and layouts are used to mock bad design practices.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment:</b> The website features misaligned elements, with text and images placed haphazardly, demonstrating the chaos of poor alignment.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity:</b> Related items are scattered randomly, ignoring the principle of grouping similar elements together, which adds to the site's intentionally confusing layout.</li>
            </ul>
