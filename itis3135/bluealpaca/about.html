                <h2 >About</h2>
                <p>Blue Alpaca Fuzzy Finds was born from a childhood memory—one of cozy afternoons spent curled up with the softest plush toys and scribbling in fuzzy-covered notebooks. Blue Alpaca wants to create a space where others can experience that same sense of comfort and joy. Inspired by the calming presence of alpacas, known for their gentle nature and ultra-soft fleece, the shop has become a haven for those seeking stress relief, nostalgia, or simply a little extra warmth in their day.</p>
